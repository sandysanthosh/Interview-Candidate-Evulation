HOW DO YOU EVALUATE A CANDIDATE AFTER AN INTERVIEW? 
Evaluating a candidate during an interview doesn’t all boil down to if he/she is capable. You need to consider other things as well.

Here are the things you need to consider when evaluating someone for an interview:

Educational background: Especially in our field, education is essential to be considered. The more you know, the more valuable you become. 

Work experiences: Experience is as important as academic knowledge. The more experience candidates have, the more valuable they are.

Special skills/technical skills: In line with work experiences, having special and technical skills is essential to have if that skill can contribute a lot to the research and developmental projects.

Body language: You’ll know if a person is confident or holding back through their body language. 

Leadership quality: You can judge a person’s leadership quality through their ability to grow further if he/she works with you.

Critical thinker/problem solver: Giving out scenarios and fixing them is a great way to judge a person’s ability to think critically or solve problems under pressure.

Communication skills: Working with a team and collaborating with other professionals can be judged by the way they communicate with you.

Attitude: A great attitude helps maintain a positive work environment
